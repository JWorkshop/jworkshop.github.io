# John's Website

# Overview
This personal website is built using React's official starter kit `create-react-app`.
However, since the contained module `react-script` (which compiles and builds the site using webpack and other things...) is rather big (~80Mb), it is being removed and installed globally - `npm install -g react-script`.

<b>Therefore please install `react-script` before running `npm install`, `npm start` or `npm run build`</b>.

# Development
To start off developing, go to `/app` and run `npm install`, and then run `npm start`.

# Build
To build, go to `/app` and run `npm run build`.
This will run a build using `react-script` and move all built files to the root directory.
